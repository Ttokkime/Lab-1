# Lab 1: Performing Reconnaissance and Probing using Common Tools
This repository compiles the different steps I took during the lab and shows the results.

## Exploring and testing with common network scanning and anaylsis tools
### Tools used:
* Wireshark - a protocol analyzer tool taht is used to capture IP traffic from different sources
* Command prompt
* NetWitness Investigator - a tool used to categorize information on traffic
* Nessuss - a computer vulnerability scanner
* FileZilla - a protocol software tool that connects suers with FTP servers



* Conduct network probing on machines in the Virtual Security Cloud Lab (VSCL)
* Use Zenmap to do an intense scan on subnetworks
* Generate charts taht show the relationsihps between devices within the network


Below is a diagram showing the network topology of the virtual machines used in the lab
